# Sai K Kankatala's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a software developer.

## Overview

I'm more than just a developer; I'm a tech enthusiast who thrives on challenges. With a robust background in developing enterprise-level e-commerce applications using cutting-edge technologies such as SAP Commerce Cloud, Java, Spring, Spring Boot, and SQL, I'm committed to crafting user-centric solutions that are both efficient and scalable.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

It runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
